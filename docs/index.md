## Intro

I decided to make a website to showcase my Kobra Go and the mods I've performed to it.

Future udpates include:
 
* BOM with rough pricing.
* More in-depth software tutorials
* More 3D model recomendations
* More details for hardware mods!

I'll be keeping this up to date to the best of my ability!
