I decided to make a website to showcase my Kobra Go and the mods I've performed to it.

## Recommended Order of Modifications

### Klipper
This upgrade can be performed on a stock machine, making it one of the most cost efficient upgrades.
### Direct Drive
Cost and time will be the biggest sinks here, as wires will need to be extended and crimped. The cost also increases as a DD extruder must be obtained. 
### Enclosure
The highest cost and time sink. Lots of components will be needed and lots of wires extended.
