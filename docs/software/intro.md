Using third party software control is a fantastic way to make your printing experience both easier and more versatile. The crux of these upgrades is that in order to run them one will need to acquire a computer to do so. Normally a RaspBerry Pi is used (>gen3), however, we are now on our 3rd year of the great pi shortage meaning either getting creative or looking elsewhere. I was using a Lenovo Ideapad for a while, it had 8GB of ram, 4 cores and didnt break a sweat running Octoprint or Klipper. This is to say that while a Pi would be preferred and is assumed by many guides, any computer can work.
