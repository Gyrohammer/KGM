# [Arctic 40mm Fan](https://amzn.to/41AjfVg){target=_blank}\- 10/10

Extremely worth it. Once dialed in with the correct voltage this fan can move some air! Not only can it move an adequate amount of air, it can do so with a low sound profile. This fan isnt 'silent' however it is much better than smaller fans in that it doesnt produce the annoying pitch that they do. Overall, highly recommended! Just be sure to trim the pot down *a lot* as this is a server fan and can spin up really fast.
