# [Arctic 40mm Fan](https://amzn.to/41AjfVg){target=_blank}
Extremely worth it. Once dialed in with the correct voltage this fan can move some air! Not only can it move an adequate amount of air, it can do so with a low sound profile. This fan isnt 'silent' however it is much better than smaller fans in that it doesnt produce the annoying pitch that they do. Overall, highly recommended! Just be sure to trim the pot down *a lot* as this is a server fan and can spin up really fast. 

## Installation 
This fan can be used on the HMG7 or on the ENLDI print head. Ensure that a [buck converter](https://amzn.to/3HgYW69){target=_blank} is powering the fan from the hotend port on the motherboard. 

!!! warning "Fan Speed!"
    Please be careful with this fan, these are **1U server fans** and can spin up to 6K rpm (15k rpm on some versions). A fan this small at that speed can do some serious damage! Make sure you turn the buck converter down to around 5v to start and keep your fingers away from the blades.
