# All Metal Y-Axis - 9/10

After some time I noticed that my y-axis began to squeak and have some irregular movement. When I took the stock end apart I saw that while there was a metal axle and bearing, the rest of the assembly was plastic! While not bad in theory, for my use case and faster speeds this simply would not do. Not only that, but over time the metal axle will eat into its plastic housing and cause the printer to become unaligned. I then looked into finding an all-metal y-axis and found [this one!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099JMYBXT?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) The y-axis fits stock, even using the stock bolt holes in the frame! 

The x-axis is semi useless though which is unfortunate. I have not tried to modify the Go to fit it and dont really plan to. The printhead is much lighter and will have much less wear on the pulley system.
