# [5015 Fan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079BPS9Q8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1){target=_blank} \- 7/10

Pretty worth. Unfortunately with the motherboard running stock marlin the fan is either 100% on or off. This can be an issue when printing long bridges or other structures as the fan could actually blow them askew. The PWM is not very forgiving when it comes to this model. I was working to resolve this with some firmware modification but have since gone a completely different route and bought a new motherboard, so we'll see how that goes (follow up will be posted).
