# The Enclosure

As many 3d printer enthusiasts will tell you, an enclosure is the best of all worlds. You can keep VOC's (mostly) contained, reduce temperature fluctuations, control ambient temp, and much more! It was (and still is) my goal to make an enclosure that is both compatible with the Kobra Go form factor and somewhat nice looking. 

## About the Project
This has been a goal of mine ever since I obtained this printer. To build a 'bespoke' Lack enclosure for the printer. I initially was going to build one of the many existing projects out there, but found that none of them matched exactly what I wanted, nor did they fit the Go. I will be doing my best to fully document the build process, although not many photos were taken.

!!! note "Take Note!" 
    More may be added to this list in the future, this is what I can recall in this moment. A lot more than those parts went into this design, the printer itself also had to be modified.
