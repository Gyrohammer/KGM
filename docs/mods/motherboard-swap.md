# Replacing the Mainboard
I was unsatisfied with the motherboard that the Kobra Go came with, the steppers arent swappable, the pinout isnt published, and the overall knowledge of the board is very limited.

## [BigTreeTech SKR3.0](https://amzn.to/3RVYpMZ)
I looked to some alternatives and settled on the [BTT SKR3](https://amzn.to/3RVYpMZ). This board is fully supported by both marlin and klipper and has extensive documentation hosted on its [github](https://github.com/bigtreetech/SKR-3). The main downside to this motherboard is its name: its not very well known in the maker-space. This can make finding bespoke tutorials for the board difficult. You will also need to procure stepper motors for this board, as it does not come with any.

## [BigTreeTech SKR-Mini E3](https://amzn.to/3RTdHBY)
The smaller brother of the SKR3 is the SKR Mini, a board with a smaller form factor and hard-wired stepper motors. The board is much more well known in the maker-space, being one of the most popular aftermarket boards available. I personally do not run the Mini, but see no reason why it would be less capable than the SKR3. You do lose the custom stepper motor choices, and some fan ports, as well as an entire stepper, but those may not be deal breakers. If you're looking for something basic and more cost effective than the SKR3, the Mini will suit you well!
