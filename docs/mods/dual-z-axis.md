# [Dual Z-Axis](https://biqu.equipment/products/biqu-b1-double-z-axis-upgrade-kit){target=_blank} - 8/10

I have yet to print a benchy using this dual setup, so I dont know the real-world improvements. Generally though support on each end of the gantry is always beneficial so this should help in some way. I purchased the [BIQU Dual-Z Kit](https://www.microcenter.com/product/639846/Dual_Z-Axis_Upgrade_Kit,_T8-8mm_415mm_Lead_Screw_Dual_Z_Step_Motor_42mm_Upgrade_Kit_for_BIQU_B1_3D_Printer){target=_blank} which fit perfectly with the existing gantry bracket. I used the motor mount seen in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/1083sr2/kobra_neogo_dual_z_mod/){target=_blank} from /u/DrumsticknDrumstick to mount the motor to the z-post. Keep in mind if you're using the stock motherboard you'll need a splitter for the stepper motor, such as [this one from TH3D](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/dual-z-stepper-motor-adapter-w-cable/){target=_blank}.
