## [MicroSwiss Hotend](https://amzn.to/4ay9Lhq){target=_blank}

*After owning this for about a year now I can say this: get a different hotend!*

This product has been quite problematic for me as of recent. <img src="assets/microswiss_hotend.jpg" alt="MicroSwiss hotend" width="200" style="float: right;"/> The beginning was great, everything  worked well and was built well. However when it came to 
nozzle changes things got bad. This hotend uses a single set-screw to keep the heat block/throat attached to the heat-sink. Well, when one needs to change a 
nozzle they need to rotate the nozzle whilst holding the heat block to remove it. The single set screw is insufficient to properly hold it and will come loose every time. I've even had it some loose after ~30hrs of print time, leading to many a clog! 



## [E3D Revo Nozzle](https://amzn.to/3tzqX5x)

*A worthy successor?* 

I will likely be upgrading to one of Revo3D's 'quick change' hotends. I've found that I like to use a variety of diameters for my prints, easy
nozzle changes would be awesome compared to what I'm currently dealing with. When this upgrade is purchased I'll write a more complete review here.
