# [Noctua 40mm Fan](https://noctua.at/en/nf-a4x20-flx){target=_blank}\- 10/10

Extremely worth it. The little amount of noise that this fan produces is incredible. It doesnt move as much air as the stock fan, but its still effective. The noise tradeoff vs. effectiveness is easily decided for me, noise won. A caveat is the need for a buck converter to use this fan correctly, as it requires 12v while the Go sends 24v.
