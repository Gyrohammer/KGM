The direct drive upgrade! I finally made this upgrade around August, what a game changer it has been! Bowden be gone, direct drive is in town! This upgrade, as with all, can be condensed into some pros and cons. 

Pros

* Speed has been signifigantly increased.
* Maintenance is extremely easy
* Lower retraction distance, less stringing!
* Soft filament compatibility

Cons

* More ringing at high speeds
* Tedious wiring
* More print head mass
* Heat
