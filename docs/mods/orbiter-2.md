# [Orbiter 2.0](https://amzn.to/48cMzUh)

The direct drive upgrade! I finally made this upgrade around August, what a game changer it has been! Bowden be gone, direct drive is in town! This upgrade, as with all, can be condensed into some pros and cons. 

Pros

* Speed has been signifigantly increased.
* Maintenance is extremely easy
* Lower retraction distance, less stringing!
* Soft filament compatibility

Cons

* More ringing at high speeds
* Tedious wiring
* More print head mass
* Heat output

I highly recommend this modification, it has reduced printer downtime and increased print quality tremendously. That being said I would recommend you to invest in either the belted dual-z or a traditional lead screw z-axis to offset the increase weight of the drive. The x-axis can sag at full extension, best to keep that in mind if maintaining the OEM z-axis.

This mod was done in parallel to the ENDLI Orbiter 2.0 printhead mod. This combination is highly recommended!
