# About 

Welcome to my journey modifying my Kobra Go! I initially got this printer on sale at MicroCenter as my very first. From here I started with their basic software and hardware but was unsatisfied with the print quality. Linear advance didnt work, the bed leveling was slow, and the print speeds were... ok. 

As someone who enjoys tinkering I began doing just that! I decided to first post it on the [unofficial anycubic subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/anycubic){target=_blank}. Soon after another user reached out to me that a github site may be ideal for easy updates and such, to which I agreed! So here we are!

I hope to keep this documentation as up-to-date as I can and as detailed as possible.
