My method for leveling with this setup is to print four leveling squares, check their consistency, then adjust whatever corner looks the worst.

Heat up times (after a PID tune) feel much faster and as a plus the bowden tubing doesnt come into direct contact with the hotend. This means that even if you keep the OEM bowden tubing, the tip of the tube wont become burnt over time.

I learned quite a lot through this process, and figured someone else may want to do something similar. I know octoprint is usually installed on a pi, but those are currently unavailable and/or being scalped for 2-3x MSRP. I\u2019ve made it through the GPU shortage and dont want to bother with another! Anyways I found an old lenovo circa 2016 and threw Ubuntu on it.</p> <p>Host Info:</p> <pre><code>2016 Lenovo Ideapad\n\nIntel Pentium 4405U (2C/4T)\n\n8GB DDR3\n\nUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS\n</code></pre> <p>I followed the, \u201cThe Slightly Tricky Way\u201d, part of this guide published by ALL3DP. After doing most (I just realized now, typing this, that the tutorial does in fact mention adding the user to the correct groups. That\u2019ll be relevant later, woops!**) of those steps I noticed that my printer wasn\u2019t showing up in the devices list.</p> <p>Seeing this I took a look at dmesg to see what it was doing:</p> <pre><code>sudo dmesg | grep tty\n</code></pre> <p>It turns out that a plugin, \u2018brltty\u2019, was causing my printer to connect, register on the bus, then disconnect. I found a solution here, which was to uninstall brltty:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt remove brltty\n</code></pre> <p>After that I rebooted the machine, thinking surely it\u2019d be a quick connect and off to the printing wonderland. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t the case; Octoprint saw the printer in the usb port, but could not establish a connection. I again checked dmesg to see if the printer had been recognized, thankfully it was. Yet octoprint would fail on auto detect, but hang when I selected a baud rate. It turns out it was just a permissions issue!** During the steps to install octoprint, a new user, octo, was created with minimal permissions. In order to allow \u2018octo\u2019 to read the USB devices and access them it must be added to the \u2018dialout\u2019 group via:</p> <pre><code>sudo adduser octo dialout\n</code></pre> <p>After doing that the auto connect worked! I got my KG to connect automatically with a baud rate of 115200.</p> <p>One of the awesome features of octoprint is camera monitoring, which the laptop has built in via the webcam. Unfortunately, octoprint doesn\u2019t support native cameras but instead supports viewing a stream from some camera.
