I also saw that it came with springs which I thought might fit around the bed bolts. Turns out they do! By swapping out the plastic pillars for these springs, the bed can be adjusted to be more consistent and flush vs the stock plastic pillars. My method for leveling with this setup is to print four leveling squares, check their consistency, then adjust whatever corner looks the worst. To see results faster, I use the mesh visualization feature in Octoprint since it also lets me see numbers. I feel like a normal ender 3 kit may fit this printer, but I\u2019m not certain. That will have to be an experiment for another time.Capricorn</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#capricorn-bowden-tube-610","title":"Capricorn Bowden Tube - 6/10","text":"<p>This is standard for the ender 3 community, and plays fine with the Go. I will say the OEM extruder had issue pushing filament through when first installed. Eventually it worked but I had to make the spring arm extremely loose for the teeth to grip. I will say the benefit is that the kit I got included the  bed springs, as well as a lot of this bowden tube, for $13. I feel like thats a good enough deal for the springs and the bowden tubing that doesnt burn. Other than that I dont feel like it improved print quality.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#microswiss-hotend-910","title":"MicroSwiss Hotend - 9/10","text":"<p>Expensive? Yes. Worth? Yes. This hotend has been awesome in terms of print quality and speed. It does have drawbacks though. The OEM heating capsule fits but the thermistor does not. I bought the bog standard creality thermistor which was short, so I cut some length off the old thermistor and added the length I needed. Heat up times (after a PID tune) feel much faster and as a plus the bowden tubing doesnt come into direct contact with the hotend. This means that even if you keep the OEM bowden tubing, the tip of the tube wont become burnt over time. My OEM tubing was burnt/burning after owning the machine for a month and only printing PLA/+ with the stock hot end.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#microswiss-extruder-810","title":"MicroSwiss Extruder - 8/10","text":"<p>Another expensive but worthwhile upgrade. This has helped an immense amount vs the OEM extruder.  With OEM tubing, the OEM extruder is acceptable, I never had issues with it. Retraction with the microswiss (MS) extruder is much better. My distances are much shorter with lower speed vs stock (3.5mm MS vs 7.5mm stock). After moving to Capricorn, the OEM extruder couldn\u2019t get a consistent grip. The MS is dual geared so its got a lot more grip and I\u2019ve had no issues since. The only caveat is that you\u2019ll have to swap pins on the plug to get it to work correctly. I watched this video to do it, takes about 10 seconds.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#5015-fan-710","title":"5015 Fan - 7/10","text":"<p>Pretty worth. Unfortunately with the motherboard running stock marlin the fan is either 100% on or off. This can be an issue when printing long bridges or other structures as the fan could actually blow them askew. The PWM is not very forgiving when it comes to this model. I was working to resolve this with some firmware modification but have since gone a completely different route and bought a new motherboard, so we\u2019ll see how that goes (follow up will be posted).</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#5015-shroud-910","title":"5015 Shroud - 9/10","text":"<p>Bit of a self plug, but I created this print head/shroud to house a single 5015 to give that maximum cooling potential. As I mentioned above, the fan can blow structures away but often times it doesnt. Definitely helps bridging and overhangs, I have examples of those results within the description of the part.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#noctua-40mm-fan-1010","title":"Noctua 40mm Fan- 10/10","text":"<p>Extremely worth it. The little amount of noise that this fan produces is incredible. It doesnt move as much air as the stock fan, but its still effective. The noise tradeoff vs. effectiveness is easily decided for me, noise won. A caveat is the need for a buck converter to use this fan correctly, as it requires 12v while the Go sends 24v.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#buck-converters-1010","title":"Buck converters - 10/10","text":"<p>These things are so useful, they can take 24v input and dial it to whatever output voltage you need. I currently have these running the noctua and arctic fan. These are also useful for any other applicable projects, so thats nice.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#dual-z-axis-810","title":"Dual Z-Axis - 8/10","text":"<p>I have yet to print a benchy using this dual setup, so I dont know the real-world improvements. Generally though support on each end of the gantry is always beneficial so this should help in some way. I purchased the BIQU Dual-Z Kit which fit perfectly with the existing gantry bracket. I used the motor mount seen in this post from /u/DrumsticknDrumstick to mount the motor to the z-post. Keep in mind if you\u2019re using the stock motherboard you\u2019ll need a splitter for the stepper motor, such as this one from TH3D.</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#firmwaresoftware-alternatives","title":"Firmware/Software Alternatives","text":"<p>Using third party software control is a fantastic way to make your printing experience both easier and more versatile. The crux of these upgrades is that in order to run them one will need to acquire a computer to do so. Normally a RaspBerry Pi is used (&gt;gen3), however, we are now on our 3rd year of the great pi shortage meaning either getting creative or looking elsewhere. I was using a Lenovo Ideapad for a while, it had 8GB of ram, 4 cores and didnt break a sweat running Octoprint or Klipper. This is to say that while a Pi would be preferred and is assumed by many guides, any computer can work. </p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#octoprint-810","title":"Octoprint - 8/10","text":"<p>Acting as a remote control host, Octoprint controls your printer via a web interface while keeping all other software stock.

Klipper is similar to marlin, but offloads a lot of the complex calculations to a head unit (pc/raspi) which allows for faster print speeds and artifact-reduction. Keep in mind that Klipper doesnt use a screen, it is web-interface only. Personally I enjoy that, but ymmv! This is definitely something to look into and a fantastic way to make the Go more performant.</p>"},{"location":"mod_list/#stock-modifications","title":"Stock Modifications","text":""},{"location":"software/","title":"Software","text":""},{"location":"software/#ubuntuoctoprintmotion","title":"Ubuntu+Octoprint+Motion","text":"<p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the past few hours configuring and setting up octoprint to work on my Kobra Go (KG). I learned quite a lot through this process, and figured someone else may want to do something similar. I know octoprint is usually installed on a pi, but those are currently unavailable and/or being scalped for 2-3x MSRP. I\u2019ve made it through the GPU shortage and dont want to bother with another! Anyways I found an old lenovo circa 2016 and threw Ubuntu on it.</p> <p>Host Info:</p> <pre><code>2016 Lenovo Ideapad\n\nIntel Pentium 4405U (2C/4T)\n\n8GB DDR3\n\nUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS\n</code></pre> <p>I followed the, \u201cThe Slightly Tricky Way\u201d, part of this guide published by ALL3DP. After doing most (I just realized now, typing this, that the tutorial does in fact mention adding the user to the correct groups. That\u2019ll be relevant later, woops!**) of those steps I noticed that my printer wasn\u2019t showing up in the devices list.</p> <p>Seeing this I took a look at dmesg to see what it was doing:</p> <pre><code>sudo dmesg | grep tty\n</code></pre> <p>It turns out that a plugin, \u2018brltty\u2019, was causing my printer to connect, register on the bus, then disconnect. I found a solution here, which was to uninstall brltty:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt remove brltty\n</code></pre> <p>After that I rebooted the machine, thinking surely it\u2019d be a quick connect and off to the printing wonderland. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t the case; Octoprint saw the printer in the usb port, but could not establish a connection. I again checked dmesg to see if the printer had been recognized, thankfully it was. Yet octoprint would fail on auto detect, but hang when I selected a baud rate. It turns out it was just a permissions issue!** During the steps to install octoprint, a new user, octo, was created with minimal permissions. In order to allow \u2018octo\u2019 to read the USB devices and access them it must be added to the \u2018dialout\u2019 group via:</p> <pre><code>sudo adduser octo dialout\n</code></pre> <p>After doing that the auto connect worked! I got my KG to connect automatically with a baud rate of 115200.</p> <p>One of the awesome features of octoprint is camera monitoring, which the laptop has built in via the webcam. Unfortunately, octoprint doesn\u2019t support native cameras but instead supports viewing a stream from some camera. This is where things get a little more interesting, so I\u2019m going to move to step-by-step:</p> <p>Login to your host as the normal user (not octo).</p> <p>Install motion:</p> <pre><code>apt install motion\n</code></pre> <p>Set motion to be started automatically on boot:</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl start motion\n</code></pre> <p>Restart your host.</p> <p>Find where motion is hiding its master config file, normally it is in:</p> <pre><code>/etc/motion/motion.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Edit the config file with sudo privilege:</p> <pre><code>sudo nano motion.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In the file find the following lines and change them:</p> <p>move_output, on or off, toggles writing video clips to your host.</p> <pre><code>movie_output off\n</code></pre> <p>stream_port specifies the port that motion will use for the stream, can be any integer</p> <pre><code>stream_port 1566\n</code></pre> <p>stream_localhost sets if other computers on the local network can see the stream, off for public on for private</p> <pre><code>stream_localhost off\n</code></pre> <p>stream_maxrate sets the frame-rate for the stream.</p> <pre><code>steam_maxrate 30\n</code></pre> <p>stream_quality is pretty self explanatory, it goes from 0 to 100.</p> <pre><code>stream_quality 50\n</code></pre> <p>stream_preview_method look to the documentation to decide on this one.</p> <pre><code>stream_preview_method 4\n</code></pre> <p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+x</p> <p>Restart the motion service:</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl restart motion\n</code></pre> <p>In a web browser type in the IP of your machine and the port specified in the config file, as an example: </p> <pre><code>192.168.53.234:1566\n</code></pre> <p>The stream should now show up! Full motion, full color video!</p> <p>Now we can go to the octoprint settings, to \u2018Webcam &amp; Timelapse\u201d, and enter the previous URL into the \u2018Stream URL\u2019 section.</p> <p>Hit test and watch!</p> <p>So thats how I went about using an old laptop and integrated webcam to monitor my prints with octoprint!</p>"},{"location":"software/#followup","title":"Followup","text":"<p>I have since moved on from octoprint and installed Klipper.
