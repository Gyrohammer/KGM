I initially got this printer on sale at MicroCenter as my very first. From here I started with their basic software and hardware but was unsatisfied with the print quality. Linear advance didnt work, the bed leveling was slow, and the print speeds were\u2026 ok. </p> <p>As someone who enjoys tinkering I began doing just that! I decided to first post it on the unofficial anycubic subreddit. Soon after another user reached out to me that a github site may be ideal for easy updates and such, to which I agreed! So here we are!</p> <p>I hope to keep this documentation as up-to-date as I can and as detailed as possible.</p>"},{"location":"mods/arctic-40mm.html","title":"Arctic 40mm Fan- 10/10","text":"<p>Extremely worth it. Once dialed in with the correct voltage this fan can move some air! Not only can it move an adequate amount of air, it can do so with a low sound profile. This fan isnt \u2018silent\u2019 however it is much better than smaller fans in that it doesnt produce the annoying pitch that they do. Overall, highly recommended! Just be sure to trim the pot down a lot as this is a server fan and can spin up really fast. </p>"},{"location":"mods/belted-z-axis.html","title":"Belted Z-Axis - 8/10","text":"<p>This belted z-axis mod from Kevin is one of the more involved upgrades one can perform on a Kobra Go. It involves replacing the two rear brackets with some 3D printed ones which then have to be modified to fit the eccentric nut that the Go uses. The crossbar of the frame must also be removed and replaced with a standard 2020 aluminum extrusion. </p>"},{"location":"mods/belted-z-axis.html#replacing-the-crossbar","title":"Replacing the Crossbar","text":"<p>In order to replace the crossbar one must obtain some 2020 aluminum extrusion. A single extrusion must then be cut to 330mm in length, and holes drilled through the top to secure it onto the frame. I used a drill press at work, and made a stencil to get the holes correct.</p> <p></p> <p>After this modification is complete, just follow the steps outlined in the guide on Kevins website!

When I took the stock end apart I saw that while there was a metal axle and bearing, the rest of the assembly was plastic! While not bad in theory, for my use case and faster speeds this simply would not do. Not only that, but over time the metal axle will eat into its plastic housing and cause the printer to become unaligned. I then looked into finding an all-metal y-axis and found this one! The y-axis fits stock, even using the stock bolt holes in the frame! </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"mods/metal-tensioners.html#steel-x-axis-pulley","title":"Steel X-Axis Pulley","text":"<p>The pulley that comes in that kit is semi-compatible with the printer, but it will have to be at maximum extension and secured with only one bolt.

The beginning was great, everything  worked well and was built well. However when it came to  nozzle changes things got bad. This hotend uses a single set-screw to keep the heat block/throat attached to the heat-sink. Well, when one needs to change a  nozzle they need to rotate the nozzle whilst holding the heat block to remove it. The single set screw is insufficient to properly hold it and will come loose every time. I\u2019ve even had it some loose after ~30hrs of print time, leading to many a clog! </p>"},{"location":"mods/microswiss-hotend.html#e3d-revo-nozzle","title":"E3D Revo Nozzle","text":"<p>A worthy successor? </p> <p>I will likely be upgrading to one of Revo3D\u2019s \u2018quick change\u2019 hotends.

This board is fully supported by both marlin and klipper and has extensive documentation hosted on its github. The main downside to this motherboard is its name: its not very well known in the maker-space. This can make finding bespoke tutorials for the board difficult. You will also need to procure stepper motors for this board, as it does not come with any.</p>"},{"location":"mods/motherboard-swap.html#bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3","title":"BigTreeTech SKR-Mini E3","text":"<p>The smaller brother of the SKR3 is the SKR Mini, a board with a smaller form factor and hard-wired stepper motors. The board is much more well known in the maker-space, being one of the most popular aftermarket boards available. I personally do not run the Mini, but see no reason why it would be less capable than the SKR3. You do lose the custom stepper motor choices, and some fan ports, as well as an entire stepper, but those may not be deal breakers. If you\u2019re looking for something basic and more cost effective than the SKR3, the Mini will suit you well! </p>"},{"location":"mods/orbiter-2.html","title":"Orbiter 2.0","text":"<p>The direct drive upgrade! I finally made this upgrade around August, what a game changer it has been! Bowden be gone, direct drive is in town!

Klipper is similar to marlin, but offloads a lot of the complex calculations to a head unit (pc/raspi) which allows for faster print speeds and artifact-reduction. Keep in mind that Klipper doesnt use a screen, it is web-interface only. Personally I enjoy that, but ymmv! This is definitely something to look into and a fantastic way to make the Go more performant.</p>"}]}
