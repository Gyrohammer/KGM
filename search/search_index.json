I decided to first post it on the unofficial anycubic subreddit. Soon after another user reached out to me that a github site may be ideal for easy updates and such, to which I agreed!

The beginning was great, everything  worked well and was built well. However when it came to  nozzle changes things got bad. This hotend uses a single set-screw to keep the heat block/throat attached to the heat-sink. Well, when one needs to change a  nozzle they need to rotate the nozzle whilst holding the heat block to remove it. The single set screw is insufficient to properly hold it and will come loose every time.

You do lose the custom stepper motor choices, and some fan ports, as well as an entire stepper, but those may not be deal breakers.
